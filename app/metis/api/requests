 request is an end-user's perspective on a ticket. End-users can only see public comments and certain fields of a ticket. Use this API to let end-users view, update, and create tickets they have access to.
Authentication

You must use the following authentication credentials with this API:

    Use the end-user's email address, not an agent's email address as is the case with all other API end-points.
    Use your API token as the password, and append /token to the email address.

To get your API token, go to Manage > Channels in Zendesk, and then click the Edit link in the API channel.

Example

-u joe_enduser@zendesk.com/token:{YOUR_API_TOKEN}
