# Questionnaire and QuestionnaireResponses

Questionnaire ressources define data structures for data which are not directly observed (Observation) but generated from textual sources.
There can be a consideral overlap between Questionnaire and Observation (further discussion see FHIR site).

QuestionnaireResposes carry the actual data an are more or less identical to the defining Questionnaire.  
At least the linkID is needed to correlate with the corresponding Questionnaire.
In most cases QRs carry also textual context info for convienience and data display.
The QR should be generated by transformation (qrtf.xqm) for alignment and consistency.
Furthermore, also the XFORM (editable; qrxform.xqm) and XHTML (readnly; qrxhtml.xqm) formulars can be generated by transforms.
