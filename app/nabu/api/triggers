A trigger consists of one or more actions performed when a ticket is created or updated. The actions are performed only if certain conditions are met. For example, a trigger can notify the customer when an agent changes the status of a ticket to Solved.

All your triggers are checked from first to last each time a ticket is created or updated. The order of triggers is important because the actions of one trigger may affect another trigger. New triggers are added in last place by default.

For more information, see Streamlining workflow with ticket updates and triggers.
